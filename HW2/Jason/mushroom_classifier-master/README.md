# Decision Tree and Naive bayesian implementation (Python)

This python implementation is only tuned for categorical values

## Prerequisites

You need to have Python 3.5/3.6 installed on your computer
<br>
Also, this implementation has used numpy for data manipulation. To install numpy, please follow the instructions.
<br>
In your console or terminal, type:

```
$ pip3 install numpy
```

## Running the Test

If you want to use the default training and testing data (mushroom dataset), you only need to run:
```
$ python3 c45.py
```
```
$ python3 naive_bayesian.py
```
Otherwise, you need to specify the training dataset and the test dataset you want to use in the command line:
```
$ python3 c45.py <training dataset> <test dataset> <output file>
```
```
$ python3 naive_bayesian.py <training dataset> <test dataset> <output file>
```
